RARAA – Rock Art Repository Open Access (COA/OVD/0097/2019) intends to create the first Portuguese Rock Art platform, which will give visibility to rock art data, metadata, images and 3D models, and make them available in open access, key to encouraging their reuse in further studies and also offering the possibility of analysis in the scope of new technologies. This national Rock Art data service has considerable benefits, as it will allow digital rock art data to be safeguarded, accessible, reusable and connected to international repositories. The first RARAA project aims to increase our knowledge of Iron Age rock art and the societies that created it in the Côa valley. <br><br>
The Côa valley has been well-known for its amazing Paleolithic rock art, and classified as World Heritage in 1998. Since its discovery, over 1000 decorated rocks have been identified, with chronologies ranging from prehistory to contemporary times. The impressive number of Iron Age engravings in the Côa Valley, with no parallels in the Iberian Peninsula, make them into one of the most important sites in the world regarding this chronology. Nevertheless, and despite the Iron Age being the second most important artistic phase of the Côa valley with an impressive number of engraved rocks, in 20 years only 8 have been the object of archaeological recording, and only 4 have had the complete survey published. <br><br>
Therefore, with this project we aim to develop a real quantitative and qualitative leap regarding the last two decades. In order to do so, we propose the integral study of 4 sites and the archaeological intervention of 3 sites with proto-historical occupation in the Côa valley region. The recorded data will take into account <i>FAIR</i> principles (<b>F</b>indable <b>A</b>ccessible <b>I</b>nteroperable and <b>R</b>eusable) and <i>CIDOC CRM</i> ontology, implementing an innovative methodology. <br><br>
Through workshops and dissemination in seminars and digital networks, we will encourage the use of this repository to host more Rock Art data.
