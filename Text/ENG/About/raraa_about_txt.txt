The project RARAA - Open Access Rock Art Repository, aims to create the first Portuguese Rock Art platform, which will give visibility to the rock art data, metadata, images and 3D models. These data, made available in open access, are fundamental to increase our knowledge about the Iron Age rock art and the societies that created it in the Côa valley, as well as to encourage their reuse in further studies and offering also the possibility of analysis in the scope of new technologies. The benefits of having this national Rock Art data service are great as it will allow digital rock art data to be safeguarded, accessible, reusable and connected to international repositories.<br><br>
The Côa valley has been well known for its amazing Paleolithic rock art, classified as World Heritage in 1998. Since its discovery, over 1000 decorated rocks have been identified, with chronologies ranging from prehistory to the contemporary times. The impressive number of Iron Age engravings in the Côa Valley, with no parallels in the Iberian Peninsula, make them into one of the most important sites in the world regarding this chronology. Nevertheless, and despite Iron Age being the second most important artistic phase of the Côa valley with an impressive number of engraved rocks, in 20 years, only 8 have been the object of archaeological recording, and only 4 have the complete survey published. <br><br>
Therefore, with this project we aim to develop a real quantitative and qualitative leap regarding the last two decades. In order to do so we propose the integral study of 4 sites and the archaeological intervention of 3 sites with proto-historical occupation in the Côa valley region. The recorded data will take into account FAIR principles (<b>F</b>indable <b>A</b>ccessible <b>I</b>nteroperable and <b>R</b>eusable). <br><br>
Through workshops and dissemination in seminars and digital networks, we will encourage the use of this repository to host more Rock Art data.
