My work focuses on Paleolithic, Late Pre-history and Iron Age rock art from the Northwest Iberia. My last project aims to create the first Portuguese Rock Art platform, which aims to allow digital rock art data to be safeguarded, accessible, reusable and connected to international repositories. In the last years I have also developed work and studies in Cultural Management. <br>
Areas of interest: promote development through research and public diffusion of cultural and archaeological heritage
